2. Use the below command:

Navigate to [your localhost on port 8080](http://localhost:8080) or your deployment FQDN to see the site.



## API routes

The API has a variety of routes, this is the official documentation about them.

All API routes begin with the FQDN where you deployed the website.
If deployed locally, you should use `http://localhost` instead of an IP address, otherwise some services (i.e. the Google authentication) won't work.

URL arguments are marked by a `:` in front of their name.
